# MGVO Middleware

This repository contains the source code of the MGVO middleware.  
The middleware forwards the requests to the MGVO API (https://www.mgvo.de/api) and returns the results to the client.  
It hides away the complexity of the MGVO API and provides a simple REST API.  
The middleware is written in [Ballerina](https://ballerina.io/).
